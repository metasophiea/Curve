it appears that we have to create an internal midi format, as we cannot rely on 'MidiConvert' to be either 
consistan or correct. Also MidiConvert doesn't seem to be able to export to file. APIs will be written to 
convert to or from this format, allowing for the internal code to have more consistancy with midi.
