        <p>After discovering the bug that made the site essentially unusable for any real purpose, I found myself in a depressing place. I wanted to continue working on this project that has brought me so much joy and passion, so I have decided to use the Rust programming language that I learned to make the core-engine webASM rewrite, and use it to produce a stand-alone desktop app for Mac, Linux and Windows.</p>
        <p>So far its been a little of an uphill battle, and I don't expect it to have similar functionality to the website version for some time - I have yet to even look at how I'm going to do audio. I hope however that by the end of this year (2021) I will have a large chunk of the program together. Alongside, I will also be working on the website. Partly so that if the bug is ever fixed, I don't feel like I've left it to languish for all this time. Partly so I don't feel like I'm eternally in this loop of restarting.</p>
        <p>I am using WGPU for the graphical back-end. Luckily I had most of a rendering engine already written in Rust as I had been rewriting most of the website version's rendering engine to use webASM, so I was able to copy over a lot of that code into this project and currently have a version of the engine working nicely. At the moment it can only render rectangles, but I have tested it on my desktop as being able to render around 2,000,000 rectangles in a second. Much faster than the top-speed I could get from the website version, which was about 720,000. Also thanks to the fact I could copy a lot of it over, the engine already has a moveable viewport, element render judgements, frame skipping, stencilling, a tree-based element data structure, extremity calculation, and more. Plus all the mouse/keyboard interaction code that I had been working on most recently. And one or two small editions along the way that I forgot to add in the website version, for example, multi-level stencilling. Much has had to change thanks to the switch from webGL to WGPU which has added a whole new host of issues, but I'm confident that it's shaping up to be a faster and more stable version of the engine. I hope in future to re-write certain parts to expand functionality, though currently I am trying only to match what the original can do.</p>
        <p>I'm going to keep the code secret for now, but below you can find completed applications that I've put together as I develop the larger project.</p>

                <h2>Wavey Boxes</h2>
                <p>The world famous, original recipe, EU approved, religiously important, oscar nominated, executive deluxe luxury edition visualisation program that has taken the world by storm and that all the kids are talking about, is here. That's right, Wavey Boxes has made it to desktop.</p>
                <p>2021-02-19 - Made with draft 12 of the project, as a way of testing the inter-process rendering communication, along with the system's ability to perform long-term state-based game-like actions (instead of just rendering a single frame). The wave patterns are calculated on the spot, as are the randomly selected colours.</p>

                <h2>Rectangle Count Test</h2>
                <p>Based on draft 8 of the project, these are applications used to test just how many rectangles the engine can produce and render. I recommend building up from the smallest value, and probably not running the 10m one at all.</p>
