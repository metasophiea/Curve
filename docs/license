Aside from that which can be found in the thirdparty module of the library layer; all code was written by Brandon Walsh (metasophiea)

This work can be shared and used by individuals for development, educational purposes and/or personal use. Commercial uses are subject to agreement.

Use of the lead program itself ("Curve") is given freely, though this may be subject to change as the project develops.

Distinctly; works created by use of the program are not covered by any license written here, as they are believed to be the property of the creator. This covers musical works, though could be expanded to include visual works on agreement.

Queries for all unstated, should be directed to the main (only) author. Brandon Walsh, metasophiea@gmail.com
