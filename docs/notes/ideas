- LAZERS DOING LAZER THINGS (shooter/receiver/mirror/splitter/etc)
- advanced (easier) unit placement (like stamping or/and click-n-plop)
- rotate unit around point other than their origin (maybe it's 'centre')
- auto-generated "blotchy" background (maybe other background types too)
- redo Alpha collection to be in the 100x100 pixel-per-cm resolution (and probably in a slightly different style that is less similar to any other collection)
- connection nodes reveal text when moused over (to say what they're named or if they are an input or output)
- some way of telling when a file is being loaded and the user just needs to wait
- networking cable for all units which uses the interface, to allow units to be computer controlled (whenever the computer unit gets made)
- some kind of blurring for when elements are far from the camera enough to cause them to look weird
- have dial control be like actual dials instead of like sliders
- advanced rendering, where only the sections of the viewport that are different to the last frame, are actually rendered
- sync canvas update sends, to maximize the render efficiency
- need to put together more advanced voltage control units, because all we have right now is a 0 -> 1 dial, and that doesn't cover enough
