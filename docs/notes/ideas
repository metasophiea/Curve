- LAZERS DOING LAZER THINGS (shooter/receiver/mirror/splitter/etc)
- advanced (easier) unit placement (like stamping or/and click-n-plop)
- rotate unit around point other than their origin (maybe it's 'centre')
- dev output text console thing. Maybe activate with F3 or something (maybe just the url which adds an option in the menubar dropdown)
- auto-generated "blotchy" background (maybe other background types too)
- redo Alpha collection to be in the 100x100 pixel-per-cm resolution
- connection nodes reveal text when moused over (to say what they're named or if they are an input or output)
- some way of telling when a file is being loaded and the user just needs to wait
