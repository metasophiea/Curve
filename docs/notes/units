        voltage->signal threshold
        signal->voltage activator
        signal->data activator (with area for writing in what the data message should be)
        data->voltage activator (must recieve correct instruction)
        signal->data multi-signal encoder
        data->signal multi-signal decoder (the musical keyboard sort of already does this)

        amplitude modulator
        lag processor (a box that reacts slowly to input changes, rounding things out)
        noise gate
        (some of these could use AudioWorkletProcessor-based custom audio nodes)

        tuner (like the one on the phone)

        frequency/magnitude response analyser
        histogram audio visualizer

        computation unit
            like a programmable FPGA for dealing with signals
            could also include actual programmable elements

        signal tempo divider (eg. 8 on-offs go in, before 1 on-off comes out)
        signal tempo multiplier (predictive tempo generator from input)

        chip-tune simulator synthesizer (like bleep') http://www.vst4free.com/img/ToneBytes-Bleep_3.jpg
        - three ocsilators
        - - five waveforms (sine, saw, triangle, square and noise)(square has pulse width modulation)
        - - detune (-1/0/+1 octaves and fine tuning)
        - - Amplitute ASDR envelope
        - - simplistic high/mid/low filter
        - - gain
        ...I'm going to have to do some investigations into Bleep' to discover what each option does
