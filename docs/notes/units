        chip-tune simulator synthesizer (like bleep') http://www.vst4free.com/img/ToneBytes-Bleep_3.jpg
        - three ocsilators
        - - five waveforms (sine, saw, triangle, square and noise)(square has pulse width modulation)
        - - detune (-1/0/+1 octaves and fine tuning)
        - - Amplitute ASDR envelope
        - - simplistic high/mid/low filter
        - - gain
        ...I'm going to have to do some investigations into Bleep' to discover what each option does
