[XXXX-XX-XX:1] moving groups of units around, doesn't work how you think it should when one of them collides with something (sorta?)
    it wasn't working great for duplication. Edits have been made to control.grapple:alt / control.selection.duplicate / control.selection.paste to allow for a more natural duplication experience (log:2019-08-22)
[2019-09-01:2] if a connection node's callback doesn't work when doing a manual connection; everything falls apart
    added try/catch code around all the callback callings
[2019-09-17:1] launchpad doesn't need to be sending out so many off signals
    just changed how the changeToColumn function works, so that it only clears the signals that are changing, or are repeat 'on' signals. Also made similar changes to how the columns are lit/dimmed
[2019-09-07:1] 8 track mixer panning is wrong
    I just had the math backwards
[2019-08-16:1] control.scene.load(1) there should be some protection for bad URLs
    things seems fine...I must have fixed it at some point
[2019-07-31:1] control.interaction.mouseGripPanningEnabled when disabled doesn't allow for "click anywhere else" unit deselection
    /main/4 - control/mouse.js:://panning moved "_canvas_.control.selection.deselectEverything();" to before the switch, so it always run
[2019-09-26:1] ending a note too quickly on the basicSynthesizer results in a snap sound
[2019-08-25:1] synthesizer circuit: Regarding the wobble features, seems you can set them too high and collisions can occur
    changed library.audio.changeAudioParam's "cancelScheduledValues" call from
        if(cancelScheduledValues){ audioParam.cancelScheduledValues(context.currentTime); }
    to
        if(cancelScheduledValues){ audioParam.cancelScheduledValues(0); }
    which seems to have fixed whatever collisions were occurring


[2019-08-03:1] buttons atop buttons don't hover right, nor click right
[2019-08-16:2] sink unit is somehow still connected to audio when cables are removed (at least, according to the levels)
[2019-08-26:1] (?) connection nodes can work across panes (is it really an issue though?) 
[2019-09-01:1] snapping and unit collision don't play well together
[2019-09-15:1] something is up with webGl on windows, that isn't present on mac or linux..I think only with clipping
[2019-09-26:2] sometimes the camera panning gets stuck on
[2019-10-06:2] sometimes the scene loader doesn't do anything
