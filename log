  - updated keyboard interaction, so now objects have to declare what keys they
    want to use, and what modifiers will go with them (none, meta, control, alt
    and shift) The system behind handles everything else, and knows to run the
    global functions if nothing matches. Objects will also be told about 
    modifier keys that accompany a key.
  - wrote up an audio duplicator and added it to test situation 8

  future ideas
  - onmouseleave for objects?

  - periodicWaveMaker's slides were entering values upside-down, so, fixed that
  - renamed 'compiler.py' to 'gravity' on Dylan's suggestion as it sounds cooler

  future ideas
  - make the audio connection nodes and cables flicker with the audio that they
    are carrying
  - redo keyboard capture, so object don't capture the entire thing when they
    only want one key. Have the objects declare what keys they want.

  - fixed a problem with the dial_continuous, slide_horizontal and 
    slidePanel_vertical where applying overlapping smoothSets caused confusion
    in the animation. Now, the previous one is just cancelled and the new one
    takes over from where the old one left off
  - updated the synthesizer to incorporate different transition curves in attack
    and release (exponential still doesn't work though)
  - had to reverse sin/cos periodic wave input in the synthesizer..curious
  - began work on an audio scope, it can accept audio data and visualize it,
    there's also a 'hold' key and a dial for adjusting the refresh rate

  future ideas
  - audio duplicator
  - audio combiner

  - fixed key_rect in test situation 1 test object (remember not to on
    onmouse-anything. It's all onkey-something)
  - added curve maker into utilities (linear, reverse_linear, sin, cos, s,
    exponential)
  - added smoothSet to dial_continuous, slide_vertical, slide_horizontal,
    slidePanel_vertical and slidePanel_horizontal
  - in test situation one, the rect_button now causes some new functions
  - updated the synthesizer to have smooth transition options when setting gain
    and detune (exponential doesn't seem to work though; but user-defined does
    ..curious)
  - updated basicSynth to accept smooth changing values for gain and detune, and
    adjust the dials and synthesizer accordingly along with the stored value for
    any new oscillators that are created during the time of transition

  future ideas
  - change attack and release in basicSynth and the synthesizer to incorporate
    different transition curves

  - added glowbox to test object in test situation one
  - deleted unneeded files
  - fixed up the first test situation a little to use the latest writings
  - looked into adding curve-based movement to the synth and continuous dials
    dials
