|  Truthfully; considering how the system works as a whole - what with the connection       |
|  nodes and such - there really is no need to produce some standard way of creating a      |
|  synthesizer. So long as you use the nodes correctly and keep things rather efficient,    |
|  who cares how the internals work. Workspace is designed for this sort of modularization  |
|  so, only worry yourself with the networking standards, and have fun everywhere else      |

    - Synthesizer 1
        a very simple synth, that produces simple tones from the note data provided. It uses a series of 
        oscillators - one produced per tone requested - which are attached to an aggregator node, which
        itself is attached to a main-output node. Two oscillators of the same frequency cannot be created.
        If a second is requested; the newer gain value will be applied to the existing oscillator. All
        oscillators are set to produce at a gain of 1, with the main-output node being in charge of the 
        synths output gain overall.

            A produced tone has a number of attributes that are assigned to the oscillator upon its creation
        and cannot be adjusted, with one exception.
            waveType        - the waveform to use (sine, square, triangle, sawtooth or the periodicWave)
            periodicWave    - a fully definable custom waveform 
            attack          - the amount of time after a tone is begun before the oscillator's output is at 100%
            release         - the amount of time after a tone has ended before the oscillator's output is at 0%
            octave          - for adjusting the requested note's octave up or down, before the oscillator is started
            detune*         - for adjusting the oscillator's frequency output by a number of cents
                            - *this is the exception. An option exists in this synth to adjust the detune of all active
                               oscillators to a certain value (along with any new oscillators that are produced)

    - Synthesizer 1: wobbling gain
        This is an modification of Synthesizer 1, where an extra gain node has been placed in the flow chain. This node
        is controlled by a interval function, which uses the values 'wobbleDepth' and 'wobblePeriod' to determine how
        fast to adjust the gain, and how deeply.
            For example, a 'wobblePeriod' of 1 second with a 'wobbleDepth' of 0.5; will produce an output that reduces
        the output from 100% to 50% then back to 100% over the course of a second.

    - Synthesizer 1: wobbling detune
        Very similar to the "Synthesizer 1: wobbling gain" synthesizer; this synth can adjust the detune in a periodic
        fashion. Its rather unfinished, as it was mainly a prototype in preparation for Synthesizer 2.

    - Synthesizer 2
        This synth builds on the last three, incorporating the wobbling elements of the previous two. It also limits 
        the detune wobble period minimum to 0.01 seconds.

    - Synthesizer 3
        this synth is designed with pre-defined gain envelopes in mind. Note requests with a velocity of zero are ignored;
        all others produce a new oscillator. Produced oscillators have a built-in lifetime after which they will self-destruct.

    terminology
        oscillator
            an element that can produce a single, periodic, constant tone of a certain waveform, frequency and gain. 
            This element can have its frequency and gain adjusted as it plays, though not it's waveform
        modulator
            an element that uses an oscillator or a collection of oscillators to produce a series of tones with
            different frequencies
            this element can have its frequency and gain adjusted, which in-turn, affect the oscillators used
            within simultaneously
        synthesizer
            an element that uses modulators in conjunction with other audio effect units

    different types
        Gain Envelope Type
            Attack/Release
                - the tone is played when the note is requested, and only stops when a 
                  corresponding "zero velocity" request is made.
                - when requested, the gain of a tone is brought from 0% to 100% in the
                  time frame and curve type defined by the attack. In a reflective way,
                  the gain is brought from 100% to 0% in the frame and curve type 
                  defined by the release.
                - if a request is made to change the gain to a value higher than it is
                  already at; the attack information is used. Again, reflectively, the
                  release info is used for values below the current.
            Pre-Defined
                - the tone is played when the note is requested, but stops at a determined
                  time. Any subsequent "zero velocity", or gain adjust requests are ignored
                  or treated as a new tone.
                - the duration can be any length, and the 'gain journey' can be of any shape
            Mixed
                - like a piano or guitar; when you play a note you can either let it ring and
                  end on it's own, or manually stop it. This type of generator would have a 
                  pre-defined envelope for each tone, but also an option to switch out of that
                  envelope live, from any point
        Oscillator Count 
            Single-Oscillator
                - These units only use one oscillator and will vary it's frequency when new
                note data is received. 
                - They don't create and destroy the oscillator, only setting it's gain to 
                zero when its not needed.
                - Only the most recently received note data is used.
            Multi-Oscillator
                - These units create oscillators when needed, and destroy them when they are
                finished with them. 
                - Each created oscillator is wired to a unifying audio node.
                - There is only one oscillator per frequency; when a second tone is
                requested with a frequency that is already being produced; the oscillator
                of that frequency is adjusted instead.
