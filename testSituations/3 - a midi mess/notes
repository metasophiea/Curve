/*
    this was an attempt to incorperate midi files
    into the system. Some/most elements work; once
    the file is parsed correctly, the sender is
    capable of sending midi-style signals at the 
    correct times, and the synth is able to read
    these. However, it seems the 'midiLoader' code
    is broken, and unable to deal with all midi files
